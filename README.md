## AutoRedact â€” A Screenshot Tool for Security Researchers

ðŸ”— [Available on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autoredact/pnjfdkbhcnabpiikhpamffpnlhomiepo)

AutoRedact is a handy little Chrome extension I built to make my life slightly less painful. It's designed for security researchers (like me) who are tired of juggling Snipping Tool, redaction boxes, and image editors just to submit a clean and safe report.

Instead of 10 clicks, try 2.  
Instead of forgetting to redact PII in a report, just donâ€™t.  

###  What it does

- Take screenshots instantly  
- Highlight or redact sensitive info   
- Annotate with customizable markers  
- Export like a boss  
- Works well with your broken sleep schedule


I make things that I need, and this time, AutoRedact came out of necessity and too many Ctrl+Z moments.
